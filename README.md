Template README markdown from [PurplBooth](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth)

This project represents the Course project for coursera/data science tools on S. Eannuzzi's Windows 10 desktop

## Getting Started

These instructions augment the notes from class not replace them.

### Prerequisites

See class notes.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running that were special to my environment
1. Installed Microsoft R instead of the open source R.  Multi-threaded support is needed for my other projects.
1. Changed git Bash short up to remove cd to HOME and set start in to appropriate directory
1. Turned off SSL verify to deal with corporate SSL termination by `git config http.sslVerify false`

## Running the tests
Basically, the ability to push updates.  I used the notes provided by GitHub after you created a new repository.
